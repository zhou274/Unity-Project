Thank you for buying my ZigZag - Endless Runner Game Template.

How to start:
* Just open the playScene in the main folder and play the game!
* In Unity Editor use mouse buttons to play.
* Hit T (for test) creates a pickup text message for testing purposes.
* Hit C for a critical pickup text message.
* At the player GameObject you can change the speed of the ball.

Please leave a rating, i would really appreciate it. Thank you!
